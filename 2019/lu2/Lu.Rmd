## Load libraries, such as tidyverse and tidybiology
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidybiology)
library('dplyr')

# For correlation analysis 
install.packages('DataExplorer')
library('DataExplorer')
install.packages('skimr')
library('skimr')

# For plotting 
install.packages('quantreg')
library('quantreg')
# install.packages('plotly')
# library(plotly)

#uncomment (or select) to clear environment; good for provenance
rm(list=ls()) 
```

## Import data
I mainly worked on the chromosome dataset in the tidybiology package 
```{r import, include=FALSE} 
#IMPORT YOUR DATA
#MAKE SURE TO GET THE CODE CHUNK OPTIONS SET

# I want to have a look of what datasset are inside those libraries
# data(package = "tidyverse") # tidyverse doesn't have any dataset
# data(package = "tidybiology") # It has 10 datasets
data(chromosome)
```

## Take a `glimpse` into the data in the dataframe
The dataset chromosome has 24 rows (for 24 chromsomes) and 14 variables for different properties of the 24 human chromosomes. 
```{r glimpse, echo=FALSE}
#DEPENDING ON DATA, NOT TOTALLY NECESSARY
glimpse(chromosome)
```
## More statistics by `skim` for a general sense of the dataset
```{r echo=FALSE}
skim(chromosome)
```


## EDA
I began with a correlation analysis of all the factors with each other and it turned out that all of them are positively correlated by a certain degree. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
#COMMENCE ROLLING
#MAKE COMMENTS
#WRITE WHAT YOU SEE
plot_correlation(na.omit(chromosome))
```

## EDA Graph  
Inspired by the new PCB faculty Zhao Zhang ZZ's research on regulatory gene elements, I want to explore more into the pseudo-genes and their origins. Some people might think that pseudo-genes and protein-coding genes are negatively correlated, but it is actually the opposite. After being standarized by the chromosome lengthes, chromosomes with more protein-coding genes tend to have more pseudo-genes. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(chromosome) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=pseudo_genes/basepairs, y=protein_codinggenes/basepairs),method = "auto", color=34)+
  geom_quantile(aes(x=pseudo_genes/basepairs, y=protein_codinggenes/basepairs))+
  geom_point(aes(x=pseudo_genes/basepairs, y=protein_codinggenes/basepairs))+
  geom_point(data=chromosome[chromosome$id=='Y',],aes(x=pseudo_genes/basepairs, y=protein_codinggenes/basepairs),pch=21, fill=NA, size=15, colour="red", stroke=2)+
  geom_label(aes(x=pseudo_genes/basepairs, y=protein_codinggenes/basepairs, label=id))+
  labs(x='Number of pseudo genes per length', y='Number of protein-coding genes per length', title='Chromosomes with more protein-coding genes have more pseudo-genes', subtitle='Number of pseudo genes per length vs. Number of protein-coding genes per length', caption='Data from TidyBiology | Plot from Junqi Lu')+
  theme_minimal()
```

## Final Graph
From the graph above, Y chromosome seems to have a way lower number of protein-coding genes than other chromosomes with similar number of pseudo genes per length. It seems to be an outlier of the trend. Then I made a scatter plot for the pseudo-genes percentage of every chromosome for more comparisons.  

```{r final_graph, echo=FALSE}
new_chromosome <- chromosome %>% 
  mutate(pseudo_genes_percent=(pseudo_genes/(pseudo_genes+protein_codinggenes))*100) %>% 
  mutate(variations_percent=(variations/basepairs))

# The original 3D version
# plot_ly(new_chromosome, x = new_chromosome$pseudo_genes_percent, y = new_chromosome$protein_codinggenes_percent, z = new_chromosome$variations_percent)  

# The original ggplot2 version
ggplot(new_chromosome, aes(x=id, y=pseudo_genes_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=id, y=pseudo_genes_percent, size = new_chromosome$variations_percent))+
  geom_point(data=new_chromosome[new_chromosome$variations_percent<.01,],pch=21, fill=NA, size=6, colour="red", stroke=2) +
  scale_size(range = c(.001, 7), name="Variations per bp")+
  geom_hline(yintercept=41.87, linetype="dashed", color="blue", size=2)+
  geom_text(x=18, y=39, label="Average = 41.97%", color="blue")+
  geom_text(x=19.5, y=84.53, label="84.53% ←", color="red", size=9)+

  labs(x='Chromosome ID', y='Pseudo-genes percentage (%)', title='Y chromosome has the highest pseudo-genes percentage but lowest variation', subtitle='Pseudo-genes percentage on each chromosome', caption='Data from TidyBiology | Plot from Junqi Lu')+
  theme_light()

ggsave("Lu Pseudo-genes percentage.png")
  
```

## Conclusions
The Y chromosome has way more pseudo-genes than protein-coding genes when compared to other chromosomes--almost two folds than the average of other chromosomes' pseudo-genes percentage. However, at the same time, the Y chromosome has the lowest variations per basepair. This indicates those genes on the Y chromosome, mostly pseudo-genes, might play critical regulatory roles and thus remain conservative with pressure over time. 

## Prioritized follow-up studies
1. I would like to sequence the Y chromosome from some older human samples to quantify how conservative the Y chromosome's pseudo-genes are over time.      
2. I would also like to classify the pseudo-gene formations of the Y chromosome, whether classical or processed, by investigating the number of non-coding segements, such as introns, on the Y chromosome.

## Session information for provenance and reproducibility
```{r echo=FALSE}
#PROBABLY BEST TO LEAVE THIS HERE, BUT NO NEED TO PRINT IN THE FINAL REPORT.
utils:::print.sessionInfo(sessionInfo()[-8]) 
#You can remove an item from sessionInfo(), which is a list with a class attribute, by printing the resulting object omitting one of the list items (omitted list of packages installed, but not loaded)
