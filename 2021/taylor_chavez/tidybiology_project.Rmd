## Tidybiology: Growth Factor Treatment of Engineered Skeletal Muscle
## By Taylor Marie Chavez

### Background `r fa("bolt")`

My experiments have looked at the effect of different growth factor treatment on satellite cells (__skeletal muscle stem cells__). I engineered 3D, functional skeletal muscle __myobundles__ from a pure myoblast population (sorted for CD56) then treated them with various growth factors __bFGF__, __HGF__, and __wnt7a__. Edu was incorporated to show proliferation following growth factor treatment. _Pax7_ __a satellite cell specific marker__ was used to label satellite cells within the myobundles. Image quantifications of immunostained myobundles allowed for the assessment of the amount of edu positive and _Pax7_ positive cells to determine the effect growth factors had on the cell population.

<br>
Here is a brief photo of one of my myobundle pairs in Panel A and a myobundle section with satellite cells shown in white in Panel B.

First, I wanted to begin by ensuring I would have the libraries I would need for data analysis, specifically tidyverse, tidybiology, dplyr, gglot2, ggsignif, plotrix, and fontawesome.

```{r libs, include=FALSE}

#see comments above for what each library does
library("readxl")
library("tidyverse") 
library("tidybiology")
library("dplyr") 
library("ggplot2") 
library("ggsignif")
library("ggpubr")
library("plotrix")
library("fontawesome")

```

Next, I imported and glimpsed my data to make sure it looked alright. 

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
# import my data
my_data <- read_excel("Data_Table.xlsx") 

# visualize my data
glimpse(my_data)

```

<br>
It was a relief that my data appeared to import ok and looked usable.
<br>

### Visualizing My Raw Data `r fa("eye")`
I wanted to visualize the three most important measures (Pax7+%, edu+%, and Pax7+/edu+%) individually, starting with the percentage of _Pax7_ positive cells in myobundles. I thought a boxplot made the most sense, and placed my data points on overlaying the boxplot because there are not too many point. This allowed me to more clearly see the data variation.

#### _Pax7_ Plot for Satellite Cell Population Quantification

```{r paxsevplot, echo=FALSE}
#organizes my groups so control group is on the far left side for easy comparison
my_data$GF_Treatment <- factor(my_data$GF_Treatment, 
                               levels = c("CTL","bFGF","HGF","wnt7a"))

#plots the data
ggplot(my_data) +
 aes(x = GF_Treatment, #x axis
     y = Paxsevper) + #y axis
 geom_boxplot(shape = "bullet", #shape of points
              fill = "#FF69B4") + #color of plot
  stat_compare_means(label = "p.signif", #labels significance
                     method = "wilcox.test",
                     ref.group = "CTL",
                     label.y = 65) + #moved the displayed p value so it was on the box plot
  geom_point() + #labels values
  #the next three lines label the plots
 labs(x = "Growth Factor Treatment", 
      y = "Pax7+ Percentage",
      title = "Percentage of Satellite Cells in Myobundles") +
  #I chose a minimal theme because I think it is clean
 theme_minimal()

```
<br>
<br>
From this first graph, I see a higher percentage of _Pax7_ positive cells when myobundles are treated with bFGF and wnt7a but no treatment group is statistically significant. I really don't see too much of a difference between the control myobundles and HGF.
<br>
<br>
I then wanted to visualize the percentage of edu positive cells after growth factor treatment.
<br>
<br>

#### Edu Plot for Proliferation Assessment

```{r eduplot, echo=FALSE}
#organizes my groups so control group is on the far left side for easy comparison
#it is probably redundant to do again, but it makes me feel better to have it in each chunk
my_data$GF_Treatment <- factor(my_data$GF_Treatment, 
                               levels = c("CTL","bFGF","HGF","wnt7a"))

ggplot(my_data) + #plots my data
 aes(x = GF_Treatment, #x axis
     y = Eduposper) + #y axis
 geom_boxplot(shape = "circle", #shape of point
              fill = "purple") + #color of plot
    stat_compare_means(label = "p.signif", #labels significance
                     method = "wilcox.test",
                     ref.group = "CTL") +
  geom_point() + #place the points on top of barplot
 #the next three lines label the plot
  labs(x = "Growth Factor Treatment", 
      y = "Edu+ Percentage",
      title = "Percentage of Proliferating Cells Following Growth Factor Treatment") +
 #minimal theme is clean and clear
  theme_minimal()

```
<br>
<br>
From the second graph, I see a higher percentage of edu positive cells when myobundles are treated with bFGF, HGF, and wnt7a and all are statistically significant (bFGF p < 0.01 & HGF p < 0.05 & wnt7a p < 0.01). However, if you look at the y-axis scale, the percentage of any group is not greater than 9%.
<br>
<br>
Finally, I wanted to look at the percentage of cells which were edu and _Pax7_ positive.
<br>

#### _Pax7_ Plus EDU Plot for Proliferating Satelitte Cell Assessment

```{r eduandpaxplot, echo=FALSE}
#organizes my groups so control group is on the far left side for easy comparison
my_data$GF_Treatment <- factor(my_data$GF_Treatment, 
                               levels = c("CTL","bFGF","HGF","wnt7a"))

ggplot(my_data) + #plots the data
 aes(x = GF_Treatment, #x axis
     y = EduposPaxsevposper) + #y axis
 geom_boxplot(shape = "circle", #shape of point
              fill = "cyan") + #color of plot
    stat_compare_means(label = "p.signif", #labels the significance
                     method = "wilcox.test",
                     ref.group = "CTL") +
  geom_point() + #overlays actual values over barplot
  #the next three lines label the plot
 labs(x = "Growth Factor Treatment", 
      y = "Edu+/Pax7+ Percentage",
      title = "Percentage of Proliferating Satellite Cells After Growth Factor Treatment") +
 #yay minimalism!!!
  theme_minimal()

```
<br>
<br>
When looking at the third graph of my measureables, I see a higher percentage of _Pax7_ positive and edu positive cells when myobundles are treated with bFGF, HGF, and wnt7a but only bFGF (p < 0.001) and wnt7a (p < 0.01) are statistically significant. Again, the y-axis is low in value, so the amount of proliferating satellite cells is not very high.
<br>
<br>

### Final Plot `r fa("chart-bar")`
For the final visualization of my data, I wanted to directly compare the different percentages of my groups on a single **bar graph**!

```{r finalplot, echo=FALSE}

# I want the control data on the far left for easy reference
my_data$GF_Treatment <- factor(my_data$GF_Treatment, 
                               levels = c("CTL","HGF","bFGF","wnt7a"))

my_data %>%
  select(GF_Treatment, #must select the data I want to compare to make into a bar graph
         contains("per")) %>%
  pivot_longer(!GF_Treatment, #pivot_longer creates a new dataset of my data for bar graphs
               names_to = "pos", #pos is for positive labeling of pax7/edu/both
               values_to = "percentage") %>% 
  group_by(GF_Treatment, pos) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(percentage), #calculate the mean and standard error of my data
            sem = std.error(percentage)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = GF_Treatment, #plots data and is the x value
               y = mean, #y axis
               group = pos,
               fill = pos)) + #colors the plot by pos column
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + #places the columns on the plot next to each other
  #the next three lines label the plot
  labs(x = "Growth Factor Treatment", 
       y = "Percentage", 
       title = "Comparing Growth Factor Treatment Effect on Satellite Cell Proliferation") +
  scale_fill_brewer(name = "Legend", #renames the legend
                      labels = c("Edu+/Pax7+", "Edu+", "Pax7+"), #renames the groups in legend
                    palette = "Dark2") + #changes the color of the plot
  geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), #adds error bars
                width = 0.2, 
                aes(ymin = mean - sem, #error bars are the standard error
                    ymax = mean + sem, 
                    x = GF_Treatment, 
                    y = mean)) +
  #I still enjoy the clarity of minimalism :)
  theme_minimal()


```

<br>

### Conclusions `r fa("grin-stars")`

From my final graph, I can conclude bFGF and wnt7a had the most significant impact on the population of satellite cells within myobundles.
<br>
<br>

### Prioritized Follow-Up Studies `r fa("flask")`

#### Experimental Next Steps `r fa("vial")`

Next steps involve functional testing of the growth-factor treated myobundles to determine if the increased satellite cell population increases myobundle force generation.
<br>
<br>

#### Troubleshooting `r fa("cogs")`

I would expect the edu+/*Pax7*+ population within each growth factor treatment group to make up the difference between the _Pax7_+ populations of the treatment group and control. I think I am not seeing that difference because images were taken from the middle of the myobundle and edu could not diffuse as deep as the growth factors. Follow-up studies could explore this further by taking z-stack images of myobundles to track edu diffusion into the myobundles.
