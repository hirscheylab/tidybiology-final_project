## SHAPE-MaP Analysis
RNA molecules fold onto themselves via complementary base pairing to form unique secondary structures. SHAPE-MaP uses chemical-modifying reagents (SHAPE reagents) and bioinformatic pipelines to predict secondary structures in an RNA. Nucleotides with high SHAPE reactivity are "exposed" and likely to be unstructured. Nucleotides with low SHAPE reactivity are likely to be embedded in structured regions.

## Annotated miR7 Binding Sites

CDR1as harbors over 70 miR7 binding sites of partial complementarity, allowing it to sponge miR7 without getting degraded. We hypothesize that binding of these miR7s could potentially "protect" the nucleotides from SHAPE modification. Because the bioinformatic pipeline does not account for intermolecular interactions, miR7 binding could be confounding a substantial portion of predicted secondary structures.

```{r}
SHAPE_graph_miR <- SHAPE_graph +
annotate("rect", xmin = 616, xmax = 621, ymin = -Inf, ymax = 4, alpha = 0.2, fill = "turquoise1") +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 634, xmax = 639, ymin = -Inf, ymax = 4, alpha = 0.2, fill = "turquoise1") +
    annotate("rect", xmin = 652, xmax = 657, ymin = -Inf, ymax = 4, alpha = 0.2, fill = "turquoise1") +
    annotate("rect", xmin = 671, xmax = 676, ymin = -Inf, ymax = 4, alpha = 0.2, fill = "turquoise1")

## Comparison of SHAPE Reactivity in non-miR7 vs. miR7 Binding Sites

Because the data does suggest that miR7 could be confounding predictions of secondary structure, I want to take a closer look and compare the SHAPE reactivity of non-miR7 binding sites with miR7 binding sites.


**Labeling miR7 Binding Sites**
```{r, echo = TRUE}

filter_miR7_SHAPE <- SHAPE %>% 
  mutate(site = cumsum(ifelse(Nucleotide == "U" & 
                            lead(Nucleotide, 1) == "C" & 
                                lead(Nucleotide, 2) == "U" &
                                    lead(Nucleotide, 3) == "U" &
                                        lead(Nucleotide, 4) == "C" &
                                            lead(Nucleotide, 5) == "C", 1, 0))) %>% 
 filter(site != 0) %>% 
 group_by(site) %>% 
 slice(1L:6L)

pre_miR7_SHAPE <- inner_join(SHAPE, filter_miR7_SHAPE)

miR7_shape <- 
  pre_miR7_SHAPE %>% 
  mutate(miR7 = TRUE)
miR7_shape
```

<br>

**Labeling non-miR7 binding sites**

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pre_no_miR7_SHAPE <- anti_join(SHAPE, pre_miR7_SHAPE, by = c("Nucleo_Num"))

no_miR7_SHAPE <-
  pre_no_miR7_SHAPE %>% 
  mutate(miR7 = FALSE)
no_miR7_SHAPE

```

<br>

**Compiled SHAPE-MaP data with miR7 and non-miR7 labels**

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pre_SHAPE_filtered <-
  full_join(miR7_shape, no_miR7_SHAPE)

SHAPE_filtered <- arrange(pre_SHAPE_filtered, Nucleo_Num)
SHAPE_filtered

```

<br>

**SHAPE Reactivity in non-miR7 vs. miR7 Binding Sites**

```{r, warning = FALSE}
SHAPE_filtered_plot <- ggplot(SHAPE_filtered, aes(x=miR7, y=SHAPE_Reactivity)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(y="SHAPE Reactivity") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c("FALSE","TRUE"), 
                   labels=c("non-miR7 Binding Sites", "miR7 Binding Sites")) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_text(size=11, color = "black")) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf, ymin = 0, ymax = 0.4, alpha = 0.3, fill = "black") +
  annotate("rect", xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf, ymin = 0.4, ymax = 0.85, alpha = 0.3, fill = "orange") +
  annotate("rect", xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf, ymin = 0.85, ymax = 4, alpha = 0.3, fill = "red")

SHAPE_filtered_plot_sig <- SHAPE_filtered_plot + geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("FALSE", "TRUE")), test = "t.test", map_signif_level = TRUE) 
SHAPE_filtered_plot_sig

```

## Conclusion

The extent of low SHAPE reactivity in miR7 binding sites likely reflects "protection" of these nucleotides by miR7 from SHAPE-modifying reagents rather than areas of secondary structure.

## Future Directions

Perform SHAPE-MaP on cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of CDR1as and compare predicted structures. The nuclear fraction will provide SHAPE-MaP data unconfounded by miR7 binding while maintaining biological relevance.
